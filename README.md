## Overview
Deep Energy Manager (DEM) is a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) agent for optimal building energy management. Buildings have comfort limits set by the occupants. DEM is designed to meet various objectives such as minimizing the energy cost, following certain schedules as the demand response, etc.
